# Crop-Prediction
Machine learning modelling for crop prediction

## Objective
To generate a model that predicts an appropriate crop type based on macro nutrient content of sois and its pH.

## Applicability
* This model can be used to determine which crop type would be more productive on soils with defined content of N, K, P as well as pH level.
* The prediction can be improved by adding more parameters to the model.
